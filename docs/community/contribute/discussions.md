# Discussions

Method Security leverages Github's Discussion functionality for bug reports, feature requests, and questions. Please make sure you're creating the discussion in the appropriate repository.

All Discussions handle at the Organization level, allowing the team to better track ideas, bugs, and questions across the assortment of tools that are hosted here.

If the project's maintainers for a particular tool decide to accept a new feature or confirm that it is a bug, they will close the discussion and create a GitHub Issue associated with that discussion in the tool's repository.

-   Feel free to open discussions for any reason. When you open a new discussion, you'll have to select a discussion category as described below.
-   Please spend a small amount of time giving due diligence to the issue/discussion tracker. Your discussion might be a duplicate. If it is, please add your comment to the existing issue/discussion.
-   Remember that users might search for your issue/discussion in the future, so please give it a meaningful title to help others.
-   The issue should clearly explain the reason for opening, the proposal if you have any, and any relevant technical information.
