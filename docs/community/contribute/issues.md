# Issues

Thanks for taking interest in methodaws!

We leverage [Github Discussions](./discussions.md) for all bug reports, feature requests, and questions, so please open a discussion rather than creating an Issue.

While Discussions are Organization wide, each individual repository tracks its own Issues.

!!! warning Issues created by non-maintainers will be immediately closed.
